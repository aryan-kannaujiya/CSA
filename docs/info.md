## How it works

A 4-bit carry-select adder is a compact digital circuit capable of adding two 4-bit binary numbers with reduced propagation delay, utilizing parallel processing to achieve high-speed arithmetic operations in computer systems

## How to test

By applying two four-bit digital logics and one carry at the inputs it will provide the sum and carry as output.

## External hardware

four LEDs representing the four bits for each inputs, carry and output.
